## Firebase billed me my own $ for February ?!

While $0.30 is a small amount of money so not too upsetting,

this should not have happened yet since we are 
still in development, and increased the priority of fixing some technical debt/a larger issue with my form component. 
_(Also a good reminder to get the boss' credit card in place . .)_

This project is on a Blaze Plan so we can run backups of the real time database, 
but the free tier has to be surpassed before any charges are inccured.

## So how did we blow through our outgoing bandwith allowance on firebase's free tier?

The project requirement for the form component I was building outlined 
that if a user leaves the page that we don't lose all of their 
inputs so they can come back later and pick up the draft where they left off. 
I had wired it to update firebase when it updated state, easy, simple and worked well. 
You can probably see where this is going.
This was shortsighted at best, since a database call on every key 
stroke was bound to add up. Having used firebase on multiple platforms with many many users, I 
chalked this temporary(read crappy) solution as fine since having enough users to hit the limits of the
free tier would be a "high class problem".

Not totally naive to this future/pending issue I was creating, I had taken stab at a `componentWillUnmount()`
solution, but this doesn't fire if a user closes the browser and so 
had abandoned that pursuit and in interest of shipping and picking up another story, I wired it up 
the aforementioned ineffcient wrong way and off we went. 

Taking some time to work this weekend(No I don't work at Revolut (zing)), I came up with a better/will be much cheaper
solution for the form component. 

Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/beforeunload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beforeunload</a> event

_Note:_ I am using this `beforeunload` without `event.returnValue = ''` so there is no confirm close 
dialogue for user to click "leave" or "close" etc

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
 window.addEventListener("beforeunload", e => this.unloadUpdate(e));
}


unloadUpdate = e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  //Pseudo code starting here will need db ref and project state etc 
  //create a form object formObj here from state and update the db record
  projectRef
    .child(projectId)
    .update( formObj)
    .then(console.log("Saved your draft you lucky duck. . . but this wont show up anywhere"))
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("You'll never get a console log since you/they are closing the browser " + error.code);
    });
};
```
