Running shell and CLI commands in PC terminal ?
</span>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a project where our repo ran some shell commands as part of the start script. Works fine on my mac. Then starting on a pc I was at a loss to why these shell and other commands did nothing. Searched around for information as to why this wouldn't work on pc:

<br />
<br />

```javascript
    "start": "sh -ac '. ./.env.${REACT_APP_ENV:-staging}; react-scripts start'",
```

and after finding many reputable AC contractors in the area...

Stumbled across the ability to turn on the linux subsystem in windows 10.

 <h3>
    Go to Windows Features and scroll down and toggle linux for subsystem on
  </h3>
<br/>

    alt="Windows Features toggle linux subsystem check box"
  />
<br/>
<br/>

If only I had been tipped off sooner, would have been saved from a frustrating goose chase neatly punctuated by slack pings for updates on the "fast" tweaks I had promised in standup.
